Userscripts developed by me

# Installation
Click on any script then click "Raw" (the links below are raw links) and your userscript manager should open. If you are using Cromite you may have to save the userscript and load it in Settings.

# [A2ZAPK Quick Download](https://github.com/fxolan/userscripts/raw/main/A2ZAPK-quick-download.user.js)
Redirect to download page when you click an app on A2ZAPK and starts the download, even if the anti-adblock message is showing.
Skips some delays along the way, but the download still has to load.
It does not block ads but should work with any adblocker including via hosts.
