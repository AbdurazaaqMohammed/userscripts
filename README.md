#  userscripts
Userscripts developed by me

# Installation
These scripts were tested for use with [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) but should hopefully work with any userscript manager.

Click on any link below, or click the script in the files then click "Raw" and your userscript manager should open. If you are using Cromite you may have to save the userscript and load it in Settings.

## [Wiki Link Preview](https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/userscripts/raw/main/wiki-link-preview.user.js)
Show a preview of a linked wiki page when hovering over a link like Wikipedia does. By default the script runs on all pages and only attempts to show preview for links that contain "wiki" or "miraheze". You can modify this behavior by changing @match to match specific websites/domains you want and add other ways to identify wiki links or attempt to show preview for all links.

# Reddit scripts
Scripts designed to improve (Old) Reddit experience

## [Fix Old Reddit Image Links](https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/userscripts/raw/main/reddit/fix-old-reddit-images.user.js)
For some reason, Reddit decided to make i.redd.it and preview.redd.it images open a viewer in New Reddit when you click on them, despite them still being a direct image.
This uses a bunch of resources uselessly. Also, if you use a userscript to redirect all Reddit links to Old Reddit, it will break image links you click on because Reddit did not implement the image viewer in Old Reddit.

Solution: Since the image is still a direct image, we can just open the image link in any image viewer. So I just made a very simple website to display image from a link, put it on GitHub, and redirect redd.it images to it with this userscript.

### Notes
Just a place to note things discovered when writing these scripts.
* [Cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) recognizes scripts as invalid if there is a * in the domain.
* Cromite does not support [GM_registerMenuCommand](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php?locale=en#api:GM_registerMenuCommand).
* [ChromeXt](https://github.com/JingMatrix/ChromeXt) supports GM_registerMenuCommand but only through [Eruda](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda) which didn't work on Cromite the last time I checked.
  * For compatibility with mobile don't use GM_registerMenuCommand for anything
